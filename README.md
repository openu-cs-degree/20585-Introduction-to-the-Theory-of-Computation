# Overview

This repository contains auxiliary material for [20585 - Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20585.htm) at The Open University of Israel which I finished with grade 100.

The file [Theorems & Definitions.pdf](https://github.com/yonisimian-cs-degree/20585-Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation/blob/main/Theorems%20%26%20Definitions.pdf) contains all important theorems, definitions and exercises conclusions from the [book](https://github.com/yonisimian-cs-degree/20585-Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20the%20Theory%20of%20Computation%2C%203rd%20Edition%20Michael%20Sipser.pdf) and the [מדריך למידה](https://github.com/yonisimian-cs-degree/20585-Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation/blob/main/מדריך%20למידה.pdf).
Since the exams in this course are open metrial exams, I recommend printing the theorems file, bringing it to the exam, and pass it on to the next students who might find this useful :)
